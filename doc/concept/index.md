# Concepts
Welcome to my favorite section.
MoQ has been a multi-year journey to solve some very real problems in the industry and now it's time to flex the design.

## Layers
MoQ is carefully broken into layers to make it simple, composable, and customizable.
We don't want you to hit a brick wall if you deviate from the standard path (*ahem* WebRTC).

See [Layers](/concept/layer/) for more information.

## Standards
MoQ is built on open standards and protocol specifications.
We're in this together, even if we disagree on some details.

See [Standards](/concept/standard/) for more information.

## Use Cases
MoQ is designed to be used in a variety of use-cases.
Distribution, contribution, conferencing, and more.

See [Use Cases](/concept/use-case/) for more information.
